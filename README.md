The Matrix Vacation Responder bot logs in as you, and responds to all DMs with a
vacation message. The bot can be configured to only respond once in a given
period of time so that the person contacting you can queue up questions for you
when you return. Other ways to use the bot including responding to DMs to
previously active accounts (for example if you move homeservers).

## Usage

To run the bot, copy `config.sample.yaml` to `config.yaml` and change the
configuration to your liking.

Run the bot when you want it to respond for you, don't run it if you don't want
it to respond for you.
